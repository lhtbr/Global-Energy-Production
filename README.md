# e-Paper: Global Energy Production (GPE) - The Sustainable Cryptocurrency

## **Abstract**
Global Energy Production (GPE) is a decentralized cryptocurrency designed to encourage and fund research on renewable energy, storage technologies, and environmental impact reduction in the energy sector. Its value fluctuates based on environmental indicators, carbon emissions, and global energy sector investments. Governance operates through the Proof of Stake (PoS) mechanism, ensuring efficiency and sustainability.

## **1. Introduction**
The growing demand for sustainable energy and the need to reduce carbon emissions motivated the creation of GPE. This currency aims to provide a decentralized digital asset linked to global energy production and its environmental impacts, promoting the development of clean and innovative solutions.

## **2. GPE Objectives**
- Fund research and technologies focused on clean energy production, storage, and distribution.
- Encourage investments in renewable and low-pollution energy sources.
- Create an asset valuation mechanism based on environmental indicators and energy advancements.
- Reduce the carbon footprint of the financial and energy sectors.

## **3. Valuation Fundamentals**
GPE’s valuation will be determined by various factors, including:
- Global greenhouse gas emission levels.
- Technological innovations for clean energy generation and storage.
- Government policies and regulations on energy and the environment.
- Investments in sustainable energy infrastructure.
- Data provided by reliable sources such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and Global Energy Monitor (GEM).

## **4. Considered Energy Models**
GPE monitors and considers the following energy models for asset evaluation:
- Hydropower
- Thermoelectric
- Nuclear
- Wind
- Photovoltaic Solar
- Biomass and Biogas
- Geothermal
- Tidal and Wave Energy

New energy matrices will be integrated into the model as they are developed and globally adopted.

## **5. Governance and Consensus Mechanism**
GPE adopts the Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism, ensuring greater energy efficiency compared to Proof of Work (PoW). The PoS model allows token holders to actively participate in cryptocurrency governance, influencing strategic decisions related to asset development.

## **6. Resource Allocation**
A portion of GPE transactions and issuances will be directed towards:
- Research and development of new energy technologies.
- Environmental mitigation projects, such as reforestation and carbon capture.
- Infrastructure for renewable energy storage and distribution.
- Incentives for decarbonizing the energy sector.

## **7. Conclusion**
Global Energy Production (GPE) represents an innovative step toward the convergence of the financial sector and energy sustainability. By linking asset valuation to the evolution of renewable energy sources and environmental impact, GPE positions itself as a promising financial mechanism for a more sustainable and efficient future.
